## Welcome to my blog  

### About me  
My name is Daniel Sharp and I'll be concluding my Master's degree on Data Science in May 2018. I'm passionate about learning and applying new tools and methods all the time. In this blog I will be sharing projects of my own. I'm always open to criticism and advice, so please let me know if you find any mistakes in my code or areas of improvement!
