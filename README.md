## Welcome to my blog  

### About me  
My name is Daniel Sharp and I'll be concluding my Master's degree on Data Science in May 2018. I'm passionate about learning and applying new tools and methods all the time. In this blog I will be sharing projects of my own. I'm always open to criticism and advice, so please let me know if you find any mistakes in my code or areas of improvement.  

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dsharpc/dsharpc.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dsharpc/dsharpc.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
