# Visualizing Crime in Mexico City  

This project is based on Diego Valle's [Hoyo de crimen](https://hoyodecrimen.com/), which is a fantastic website for exploring how crime happens in Mexico City and what trends it has had. I decided give the same idea a shot using R's Shiny Apps library.  

The dashboard can be seen at:

This app is hosted on the shinyapps.io server, which offers a free tier account where anyone can upload their ShinyApps for free. Here's a guide on how to upload your own: [link](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html)
